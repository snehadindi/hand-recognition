# Hand Gesture Recognition using MediaPipe and OpenCV

This project demonstrates real-time hand gesture recognition using MediaPipe and OpenCV in Python. It detects hand landmarks using MediaPipe's pre-trained model and interprets specific gestures based on the detected landmarks.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)
- Mediapipe (`pip install mediapipe`)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repository.git
   cd your-repository
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage

1. Run the script:
   ```bash
   python hand_gesture_recognition.py
   
2. Place your hand in front of the camera. The program will detect and recognize gestures in real-time.

## Gestures

The following gestures are recognized:

Hi user!:  Thumb and index finger are below the middle and ring fingers.

Have a great day ;) :  Thumb is above the index finger while the middle and ring fingers are below.
